# PickNDrop

- PickNDrop is a project intending to create an easy and effective solution for package transportation from one place to another at an affordable price ensuring instant delivery and security. PickNDrop is basically a combination of Courier service+Ola/Uber-like services. It's different from other services, mainly courier because the main motto of project is reducing the expenses required for a common person to deliver a package to faraway cities, which involve either courier charges or traveling charges if the person travels by himself. Along with that, project intends to provide an opportunity for Service Providers to earn extra income via merely delivering a few packages that lie on the same route as their daily routes (Service Providers are transporters or any person who travels on that particular day or on daily basis to the same destination as specified in case of the package and is willing to carry the package along).
